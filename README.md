# ExploitFlow

ExploitFlow (EF) is a modular library to produce cybersecurity exploitation routes (exploit flows). It aims to combine and compose exploits from different sources and frameworks, capturing the state of the system being tested in a *flow* after every discrete action.

It's main motivation is to facilitate and empower Artificial Intelligence (AI) research in cybersecurity. EF's software architecture is inspired by the success of TensorFlow. To facilitate usage, exploits are grouped by categories following the security kill chain [^1].

<!-- EF is a modular, extensible (accepting connectors for other exploitation frameworks and/or individual exploits) and composeable library to empower Artificial Intelligence (AI) research in cybersecurity. EF is **not an exploitation framework**. -->

## Adapters
TODO

## Antigoals
*By no means the authors of ExploitFlow encourage or promote the unauthorized tampering with compute systems*.

- Favour cybercrime. Pentest for good.
- Create yet another exploitation framework, there're already too many.
- Create a new exploit database. Contribute an adapter instead.

## Usage
```python

import exploitflow as ef

flow = ef.Flow()
flow.run(ef.)
```
