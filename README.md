# ExploitFlow

ExploitFlow (EF) is a modular library to produce cybersecurity exploitation routes (exploit flows). It aims to combine and compose exploits from different sources and frameworks, capturing the state of the system being tested in a *flow* after every discrete action.

It's main motivation is to facilitate and empower Game Theory and Artificial Intelligence (AI) research in cybersecurity. To facilitate adoption, EF's syntax and architecture is inspired by TensorFlow[^1][^2]. To simplify exploitation, exploits are grouped by categories following the security kill chain [^3].

<!-- EF is a modular, extensible (accepting connectors for other exploitation frameworks and/or individual exploits) and composeable library to empower Artificial Intelligence (AI) research in cybersecurity. EF is **not an exploitation framework**. -->

### Antigoals

**Legal disclaimer**
*Access to this library and the use of information, materials (or portions thereof), is not intended, and is prohibited, where such access or use violates applicable laws or regulations.  By no means the authors encourage or promote the unauthorized tampering with running systems. This can cause serious human harm and material damages*.

*By no means the authors of ExploitFlow encourage or promote the unauthorized tampering with compute systems*. Please don't use the source code in  here to:

- Favour cybercrime. Pentest for good.
- Create yet another exploitation framework, there're already too many.
- Create a new exploit database. Contribute an adapter instead.

### Usage
```python
import exploitflow as ef

flow = ef.Flow()
a = ef.placeholder()
print(flow.run(a))  # None
```
