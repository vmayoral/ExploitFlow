# ExploitFlow

ExploitFlow (EF) is a modular library to produce cybersecurity exploitation routes (exploit flows). It aims to combine and compose exploits from different sources and frameworks, capturing the state of the system being tested in a *flow* after every discrete action.

It's main motivation is to facilitate and empower Artificial Intelligence (AI) research in cybersecurity. To facilitate adoption, EF's syntax and architecture is inspired by TensorFlow[^1][^2]. To simplify exploitation, exploits are grouped by categories following the security kill chain [^3].

<!-- EF is a modular, extensible (accepting connectors for other exploitation frameworks and/or individual exploits) and composeable library to empower Artificial Intelligence (AI) research in cybersecurity. EF is **not an exploitation framework**. -->

### Usage
```python
import exploitflow as ef

flow = ef.Flow()
a = ef.placeholder()
print(flow.run(a))  # None
```

## Adapters
TODO

## Antigoals
*By no means the authors of ExploitFlow encourage or promote the unauthorized tampering with compute systems*.

- Favour cybercrime. Pentest for good.
- Create yet another exploitation framework, there're already too many.
- Create a new exploit database. Contribute an adapter instead.
